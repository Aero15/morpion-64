## TODO list
Still have many things to do, 👁️👄👁️ look at zis :

- Play with friend ⚔️ on the network (or Bluetooth)
- 💾 Persistant data (score, profile, settings, etc...)
- Improve gameplay with new tools (or bonus) in game 💣 (bomb, suffle grid, moving cells, and more...)
- Limit answering time ⏲️ for players (with a circular progress bar behind avatar)
- Add some sound effects 🔊 for some events (you win, you loose, bot is playing, ...)
- Add a "end game" screen to display final leaderbord with earned score by players, with some confetti ✨ (hi Svelte Confetti)
- Add a "mashup" 🥗 screen to reveal order list or a "versus" screen  (P1 vs P2) before starting game
- Make bots powerful again 👿
- More symbols 😻 (animals, fruits and chess)
- More 💋💄 colors (or gradients) for players
